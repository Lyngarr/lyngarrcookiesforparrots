## üç™‚ù§Ô∏èü¶ú Lyngarr's Cookies for Parrots

This fabric mod makes parrots tameable with cookies again ‚Äî just like Mojang *almost* intended.
Seeds no longer work, and cookies are now safe and useful! Finally, cocoa beans have a purpose.

This mod is required on both client and server, and needs Fabric API.
