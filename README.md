## 🍪❤️🦜 Lyngarr's Cookies for Parrots

This fabric mod makes parrots tameable with cookies again — just like Mojang *almost* intended.  
Seeds no longer work, and cookies are now safe and useful! Finally, cocoa beans have a purpose.

This mod is required on both client and server, and needs Fabric API.
